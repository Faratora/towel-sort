## Task
Your task is to implement the so-called 'towel sort' algorithm.

`towelSort` function should expect [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure#Multidimensional_arrays) of any shape for example:

```js
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ],
]
```

Following matrix should be 'sorted' to:
```
 [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 8, 9 ]
```
You can find even more examples in `test.js`

**Active usage of [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is strongly recommended!**
